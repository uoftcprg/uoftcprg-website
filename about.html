  <h3>History</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>
    The Universal, Open, Free, and Transparent Computer Poker Research Group conducts research and develops computer programs in the field of computer poker.
    Until June 2025, the organization was an affiliated student group within the University of Toronto, under the name of the University of Toronto Computer Poker Student Research Group.

  <p>
    The predecessor, the University of Toronto Computer Poker Student Research Student Group, was founded in May 2023 by a group of enthusastic programmers and poker players.
    Since its formation, the University of Toronto Computer Poker Student Research Group has been a forum for both formal and informal discourse in the field of computer poker within the University of Toronto community.
    Most members in the group were students from the University of Toronto, but we maintained good relations with groups of similar interest from other universities.
    The group carried out research and developed open-source tools to further the worldâ€™s poker community often under the guidance of various University of Toronto Professors.
    The list of affiliated students during its operation as a student organization is available <a href="/students/">here</a>.
