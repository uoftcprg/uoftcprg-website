Since its formation, the University of Toronto Computer Poker Research Group has been a forum for both formal and informal discourse in the field of computer poker within the University of Toronto community. Most members in the group are students from the University of Toronto, but we maintain good relations with groups of similar interest from other universities. The group carries out research and/or develops open-source tools to further the world's poker community often under the guidance of various University of Toronto Professors.

Registration for new members is open [here](https://forms.gle/Sxyyo1KhfF4A2W447).
